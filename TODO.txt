--Actually load and store plugin information when loading a plugin in the AssetManager
--Add a virtual file structure so that the game knows what asset files a plugin
	contains and doesn't have to search each plugin for a file when loading
--Add ability to know when a texture is done uploading to the GPU so we can mark it as loaded and
	delete it's data

-Resources need to be loaded into vram properly using upload buffers
